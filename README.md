WebCAD!

Welcome to WebCAD! This application leverages WebGPU to render an infinite grid that supports intuitive zooming and panning. Additionally, it provides tools to draw lines, polylines, and points on the grid with consistent visual behavior regardless of zoom level.

This project aims to be a lightweight challenger to professional CAD software like AutoCAD, offering essential drawing functionalities in a simplified and accessible web-based environment.

Introduction

This project showcases an interactive infinite grid rendered using WebGPU. It is designed to be a lightweight challenger to professional CAD software like AutoCAD, offering essential drawing features for users who need a simpler tool for creating and manipulating graphical elements.

The application features:

    Intuitive zooming and panning controls.
    Consistent rendering of grid lines, ensuring grid density adjusts appropriately with zoom levels.
    Drawing tools to create lines and polylines on the grid.
    Points that maintain a constant size on the screen, regardless of zoom level.

Why a Lightweight Challenger?

While AutoCAD and similar applications offer extensive capabilities, they can be overwhelming for users who require only basic drawing functionalities. This project aims to fill that gap by providing a streamlined, web-based alternative that is easy to use and accessible from any device with a modern browser.

Features

    Infinite Grid Rendering: An infinite grid that adjusts dynamically as the user pans and zooms, providing a seamless experience akin to professional CAD environments.
    
    Zoom and Pan Controls: Intuitive controls using mouse wheel for zooming and click-and-drag for panning, emulating familiar CAD interactions.
    
    Drawing Tools:
        
        Line Tool: Draw straight lines between two points, similar to basic line drawing in AutoCAD.
        
        Polyline Tool: Draw connected lines (polylines) with multiple vertices, allowing the creation of complex shapes.
    
    Consistent Point Rendering: Points are rendered as squares that maintain a constant size on the screen, regardless of zoom level, ensuring precision in placement and visibility.
    
    WebGPU Powered: Leverages the power of WebGPU for high-performance rendering, providing smooth interactions even with complex drawings.
